     * You will learn many levels of abstraction from this book. Method abstraction is achieved by
     * separating the use of a method from its implementation. The client can use a method without
     * knowing how it is implemented. The details of the implementation are encapsulated in the
     * method and hidden from the client who invokes the method. This is also known as information
     * hiding or encapsulation. If you decide to change the implementation, the client program will
     * not be affected, provided that you do not change the method signature. The implementation of
     * the method is hidden from the client in a “black box,” as shown in Figure 6.7.
